# Project Goal
My goal for this project is to learn refactor. 
I want my coding skills for developing a website for everyone to use.
How I would refactor the coding is using applications that everyone can understand.

# My Criteria
When I view the source code, I can see what edits I can make.
The recent html 5 is modern a way of creating content for the website.
The elementals are important so you can make changes to the websites.
Overall, I think creating a good website takes time to make it well.
